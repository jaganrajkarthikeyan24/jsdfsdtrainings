Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you 
can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for 
shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Sample docker file for view layer application react

FROM node:13.12.0-alpine
COPY package.json ./
COPY package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install --silent
RUN npm install react-scripts@5.0.0 -g --silent
# add app
COPY . ./
# start app
CMD ["npm", "start"]

Sample docker file for spring boot application

FROM openjdk:11
ADD target/dima.jar dima.jar
EXPOSE 8933
ENTRYPOINT ["java" , "-jar", "dima.jar"]

Images
An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, 
with some additional customization. 
You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. 
To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile 

docker build -f Dockerfile -t dbs .

Containers
A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. 
By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine.
A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, 
any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear.

Docker Hub is a registry service on the cloud that allows you to download Docker images that are built by other communities. You can also upload your 
own Docker built images to Docker hub.
